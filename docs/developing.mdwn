## Requirements and/or instructions for developing

For developing the CMS DB Web services, you will need to do the following:

 * Request a private (virtual) machine with SLC5 or SLC6. Do so at [https://vmm.cern.ch/](https://vmm.cern.ch/).
 * Check that git, rsync and python2.6 are installed and working properly.
 * Deploy a new instance of the CMS DB Web services. Read [deploying.html](deploying.html).
 * Learn how to manage the services. Read [managingServices.html](managingServices.html).
 * If you are new to git, read the [gitTutorial.html](gitTutorial.html).
 * If you need to develop a new service, read [creatingANewService.html](creatingANewService.html).
 * Also read the tricks section of this document for easier development.


## Tricks

While you can develop using your favorite terminal-based editor within your virtual machine, you might want to use your desktop operating system for editing the code. Also, you might want to access the code in several computers.

In order to do so, move your private virtual machine's /data/services folder into your ~/scratch0 area. Then make a symlink:

	$ mv /data/services ~/scratch0
	$ ln -s ~/scratch0/services /data/services

Now you can open easily the code of the services in any computer and develop them using your favorite GUI editor.

This just works because a git repository is just a set of normal files in the filesystem.
