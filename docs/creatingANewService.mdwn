# Creating a new service


Creating a new service for CMS DB Web services is really easy with the new infrastructure.


## Quick setup

First of all, login to your private virtual machine for development and deploy CMS DB Web services. See the [related documentation](developing.html) for this.

Next, create a new folder for your service. The name is arbitrary, but try to follow the camelCase convention:

	$ cd /data/services
	$ mkdir myService

Then copy the serviceTemplate.py from the docs:

	$ cp docs/serviceTemplate.py myService/myService.py

Take a look to the simple code and after that create an empty server.conf file:

	$ touch myService/server.conf

Now add an entry in the keeper configuration to register your service:

	$ your_favorite_editor keeper/config.py

like this:

	'myService': {
		'filename':      'myService.py',
		'listeningPort':  9999,
	},

Open the port you picked in your firewall:

	# system-config-firewall

Then, as an example, edit the secrets file and add one:

	$ your_favorite_editor /data/secrets/secrets.py

like this:

	'myService': {
		'biggestSecret': 'that the sky is blue!',
	},

Go to the keeper and start your service:

	$ cd keeper
	$ ./keeper.py start myService

And check that it is running correctly:

	$ ./keeper.py status

And finally browse to the link that appears in the status' output.

You should be able to read something like:

	I am myService, I am listening on 9999, with production level "private", my root directory is /afs/cern.ch/user/m/mojedasa/scratch0/services/myService and my biggest secret is that the sky is blue!!

That's it! You don't need anything else to start developing! :)
