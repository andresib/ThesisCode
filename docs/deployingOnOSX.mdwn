# Deploying on OS X


## Introduction

The deploy script knows how to deploy on OS X, although it is not officially
supported i.e. contact us if it does not work for you and we will try to fix it,
but we cannot promise it will be always working.

For starters, it has been only tested in Mountain Lion and there are some
previous steps you will need to do manually. This document describes them.


## Install AFS

You need to install AFS in OS X. Please follow the instructions at:

  * <http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/afs/howto/openafs-mac-os>

and/or download your binary at:

  * <http://www.openafs.org>

The procedure should be easy to follow.

Before running the deploy script, please make sure OpenAFS is started
and that you have the Kerberos ticket and the AFS token:

    $ kinit username@CERN.CH
    $ aklog


## Install redis

You need to install redis as well. The one from MacPorts:

  * <http://www.macports.org>

seems to work fine:

    $ sudo port install redis

Please check that redis-cli and redis-server are in your $PATH.


## Apache configuration

The deploy script will use your builtin Apache server. You will get a warning
and will be asked to confirm to continue, just in case you did not read
this document, to prevent losing your configuration if you are using it
for something else.

Apache will be run under your user account.


## Testing

First, you can test whether you can start the docs service and open it directly
without Apache.

    $ /data/services/keeper/keeper.py start docs
    $ /data/services/keeper/keeper.py status

If that worked, then try to access the webpage through Apache. Remember,
we use name-based virtual hosts and we do not allow any other requests.
Therefore, you will need to access the webpage using not your IP nor localhost,
but your hostname, e.g.:

  * https://mymachine/

Otherwise you will get a 403 Forbidden reply from Apache.
